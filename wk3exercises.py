    =========== Exercise 1 =============

    I have provided some starter code below
    that creates a result variable, and a number_1
    variable. Your goal is to make number_1 equal 11
    after the operations that have been done to it.
"""

# result = 0
# number_1 = 5
# number_1 += 52 #  57
# number_1 += 9
# number_1 /= 6
# # Do more operations on number 1 until it equals eleven

# result = number_1
# print(result == 11)


"""
    =========== Exercise 2 =============

    Take input from the command line, and convert it to
    an int. Now pick a range (i.e. 0-10), and create a set
    of conditional statements that prints the string
    representation of the number input by the user.

    For example if someone put in 8, then it would print 'eight'.
    
    Hint: Use if, elif and else statements.

    figure out which print statement will
    execute and why. Then uncomment the code
    and check if you were right.
